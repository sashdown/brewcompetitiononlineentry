# Brew Competition Online Entry & Management #

## Transition to GitHub ##
With Google Code shutting down, issue tracking and downloads has been transitioned to [GitHub](https://github.com/geoffhumphrey/brewcompetitiononlineentry/issues).

## January 1, 2015: BJCP 2014 Styles Integration Coming Soon ##
Support for the new BJCP 2014 style guidelines is coming soon. However, further testing is needed to integrate into the BCOE&M core.
The BJCP fully expects that a "transition period" will be necessary for competitions in the early part of this year. If you want to use BCOE&M for your competition, it is acceptable to use the 2008 guidelines until the 2014 ones are integrated into the system.
As of January 5, 2015, the BJCP itself has not published an official version of the 2014 guidelines - nor have they updated their website style center.
Stay tuned.

For those experiencing any issues related to initial browser-based setup of BCOE&M, the bcoem\_baseline\_1.3.0.X.sql document was added to the package. It contains the necessary database structure and dummy data for a NEW installation that can be installed manually via phpMyAdmin or shell access. Be sure to follow the directions in the document **before** use, especially those relating to security.

## Version 1.3.0.0 Released ##
Due to some issues that arose since the initial release of Version 1.3.0.0, it was decided to pull the release package to perform some additional tests. Those issues have been addressed and the package is now available.

## About Version 1.3.0.0 ##
This release marks some major improvements to stability, security while addressing server load issues:
  * Code extensions in the form of custom modules - admins can extend the functionality of BCOE&M with their own HTML or PHP code (advanced users only - not available for hosted installations).
  * Barcode option for bottle entry forms and entry check-in so comp staff can use a barcode scanner to check-in entries and assign judging numbers them. The methodology was tested in the 8000+ entry National Homebrewers Competition this year and was very well received by the competition staff.
  * Entry limit per user option.
  * Pre-registration option - users can create their accounts and enter their personal information, judging preferences, etc. before entries are accepted.
  * Subcategory entry limit per user option - from unlimited to a single entry per user per subcategory.
  * Subcategory entry limit exception option - for those subcategories that lend themselves to a broader range of interpretation (e.g., Specialty Beer, Spice/Herb/Vegetable Beer, Open Category Mead, Specialty Cider and Perry, etc.).
  * Admin ability to enable/disable search engine friendly URLs for all public pages.
  * Extended printing options including larger round bottle labels, labels with special ingredients, category/subcategory only labels, etc.
  * Expansion of recipe-related fields to accommodate more ingredients - malts/grains, other fermentables, and hops increase to 20 fields each, mash schedule increases to 10.
  * Enhanced recipe entry with robust checks for the presence of required information for certain styles (e.g., special ingredients for Category 23, strength for mead styles, etc.)
  * Extended use of session variables to limit calls to the MySQL database for redundant/constant pieces of information customized for each user.
  * Numerous behind-the-scenes coding clean up and enhancements aimed at improving performance and reducing page load times.

## Version 1.2.1.2 ##
This release again features mostly bug fixes and a few enhancements.

  * Enhanced the data integrity checking for sub-styles that require participants to enter special ingredients and/or a classic style (beer, mead, cider), as well as strength (mead), and carbonation/sweetness (mead, cider).
    * If participants do not add the requisite information, their entry is marked "unconfirmed," and subject to deletion after 24 hours.

  * Deprecated the option to choose whether to utilize BCOE&M for competition organization. Going forward, it will be assumed that Administrators will utilize the organization functions (those beyond simply gathering participant and entry data) as little or as much as they wish without needing to specify as such.
